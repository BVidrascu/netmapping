											<h2>What is Netmapping?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>"Net-Map is an interview-based mapping tool that helps people understand, visualize, discuss, and improve situations in which many different actors influence outcomes. By creating Influence Network Maps, individuals and groups can clarify their own view of a situation, foster discussion, and develop a strategic approach to their networking activities. More specifically, Net-Map helps players to determine
											what actors are involved in a given network,
											how they are linked,
											how influential they are, and
											what their goals are." (Schiffer, 2007)</p>

									<h2>Methodology</h2>
									<p>
										In a structured process conducted over two meetings with experts within the medical field, we developed a comprehensive stakeholder map pertinent to the implementation of the European Code against Cancer. Initially, <b>stakeholders</b> were identified and each represented by a post-it note on a large paper canvas. These entities were systematically categorized according to their <b>operational level</b> (regional, national, and European) and <b>organizational type</b> (NGO, academia, private, or public institutions). To quantify each stakeholder's perceived <b>influence</b>, we employed an innovative method of stacking magnets on the respective post-it notes, with a higher number of magnets indicating greater influence.
										<br><br>
										Subsequently, the experts delineated four distinct types of inter-stakeholder relationships: <b>communication, influence, authority, and financial</b> flow, by drawing lines between the post-its. This initial analog mapping was eventually digitized, leading to the creation of a sophisticated <b>visual representation</b> that facilitates the inspection of the complex network of interactions and hierarchies among stakeholders involved in the European Code against Cancer's implementation.</p>
